# Portfolio Version 1 (Legacy)

🌱 **This is my first-ever personal portfolio website.**
Built purely using **HTML and CSS**, this project represents where my journey into web development began.

This version is intentionally kept live as a **legacy archive** to transparently showcase my growth as a developer and designer over the years.

## 📌 Purpose of This Project

The goal of this portfolio was simple:

* Learn the fundamentals of **HTML structure**
* Understand **CSS styling and layouts**
* Build and deploy a real website from scratch
* Create an online presence with zero frameworks or libraries

At the time of building this project, my focus was on *learning by doing*, not on perfect design or advanced UX patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Page structure and content
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **No frameworks** (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind)
* **No JavaScript**
* **Static deployment**

This project was intentionally kept minimal to strengthen core web fundamentals.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy (At the Time)

* Simple layouts using **divs and basic CSS positioning**
* Static navigation
* Image-heavy sections
* Focus on *content over polish*

While the visual design may feel outdated today, it accurately reflects my skill level and design understanding at the time.
